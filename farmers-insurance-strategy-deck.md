# Farmers Insurance Account Strategy Deck
## 6-Slide Executive Presentation | 90-Day Critical Window

---

## SLIDE 1: Executive Summary

### Account Snapshot
**Farmers Insurance** | $14B Revenue | 21,000 Employees
- **Current Platform Footprint**: 200 Authors, 350 Business Users, 2 DQ Connectors
- **Renewal Timeline**: December 2026 (10 months)
- **Account Health**: GREEN ✓
- **TAM Owner**: Naga Chaitanya Bondalapati

### 🔴 90-Day Critical Window (Feb - Apr 2026)

**Timeframe**: February - April 2026
- **Why Now**: New CDO (Ryan Niderno) setting priorities, CEO-backed transformation initiative, December renewal requires Q2-Q3 execution momentum
- **Risk**: Window closes if we don't engage Ryan/Kumar on 2026 priorities NOW

### New Leadership Context
- **Ryan Niderno** (NEW CDO, from Travelers) - Positive on OvalEdge vs. Alation
- **Kumar** (VP Analytics) - Established OvalEdge Champion
- **Mark Marshalek** (Head of Data Governance) - Strong existing relationship
- **CEO-Backed Initiative**: Transform to "true data culture organization"

### Total Opportunity Summary
| Opportunity | Value | Status |
|------------|-------|--------|
| License Expansion (40-60% ARR) | $400K-$600K | Q2-Q4 |
| Services/Advisory TAM | $556K | 5 business cases detailed |
| **Total 90-Day Opportunity** | **$956K-$1.156M** | **Licenses + Services** |

### Strategic Context
- Insurance vertical reference customer + askEdgi showcase opportunity
- 2026 priorities perfectly aligned with OvalEdge roadmap (Marketplace, AI governance, automated DQ)
- CEO backing creates dedicated budget for tools + advisory services

### Next 90 Days Preview
1. **Engage Ryan & Kumar** on Marketplace, UI/UX, askEdgi priorities
2. **Position askEdgi** for automated DQ + marketplace reusability
3. **Lock in executive sponsorship** (Paul Wilson - COO) before Q2 ends
4. **Secure pilot commitments**: askEdgi 50 users, DQ expansion 5-8 connectors

---

## SLIDE 2: SWOT Analysis (OvalEdge Perspective)

### STRENGTHS (Internal, Positive)

✓ **Strong existing relationships**: Mark Marshalek + Kumar as established champion
✓ **NEW CDO advantage**: Ryan prefers OvalEdge over Alation (Travelers experience validates our approach)
✓ **Proven adoption**: 200 Authors + 350 Business Users actively using platform
✓ **Massive expansion potential**: Only 2 DQ connectors for 21K-employee organization = 5-8x growth opportunity
✓ **Product-market fit**: askEdgi aligns perfectly with 2026 priorities (Marketplace + automated DQ)
✓ **CEO-level backing**: Data transformation is CEO priority, not just IT initiative
✓ **Account health GREEN**: No churn risk, 10 months to renewal = runway for expansion

### WEAKNESSES (Internal, Negative)

✗ **No relationship with new CDO Ryan**: Just joined - critical gap to close immediately
✗ **UI/UX concerns**: Ryan/Kumar explicitly called current UI "clunky" - acknowledged product limitation
✗ **Limited services history**: No previous professional services engagement with this account
✗ **SaaS transition not yet positioned**: Customer priority we haven't formally addressed
✗ **Competitive awareness**: Alation mentioned as alternative consideration
✗ **Unknown approval process**: Unclear budget authority with new CDO structure
✗ **Org chart gaps**: AI Council composition unknown, Ryan's direct reports unmapped

### OPPORTUNITIES (External, Positive)

↗ **AI Council + askEdgi alignment**: Perfect timing for AI governance + automated DQ initiative
↗ **Marketplace transformation (#1 priority)**: Governance framework consulting = core capability opportunity
↗ **SaaS migration services**: Customer wants to reduce complexity = dedicated services engagement
↗ **DQ expansion**: Only 2 connectors today, automated DQ is priority = 5-8 additional connectors
↗ **2025 data breach driver**: August breach (1.1M customers) creates PII discovery urgency
↗ **NAIC AI regulations**: Insurance AI compliance = governance framework consulting opportunity
↗ **CEO budget available**: "Data culture transformation" likely has dedicated budget allocation
↗ **Reference customer potential**: Showcase for insurance vertical if we nail Marketplace + askEdgi

### THREATS (External, Negative)

↘ **Competitive evaluation risk**: Ryan's Alation comparison suggests vendor awareness/alternative consideration
↘ **UI/UX escalation threat**: "Clunky" perception could become deal-blocker if not immediately addressed
↘ **New leadership reset**: Ryan may have different vendor preferences, clean slate evaluation possible
↘ **Budget uncertainty**: CEO programs can get deprioritized if organizational priorities shift
↘ **SaaS migration complexity**: Painful migration could permanently damage relationship
↘ **Marketplace competitors**: Alation/Collibra have mature data marketplace capabilities
↘ **90-day window closes**: If we don't engage Ryan/Kumar in Q1, lose seat at decision table

### Key Insight
**"Our biggest opportunity is ALSO our biggest threat: New CDO Ryan is genuinely open to OvalEdge (Travelers experience), but hasn't committed yet. 90-day window to prove we solve 2026 priorities OR risk competitive evaluation."**

### COMPETITIVE DEFENSE TALKING POINTS

**If Ryan asks: "Why OvalEdge vs. Alation/Collibra?"**

1. **askEdgi is unique**
   - "Alation doesn't have conversational AI for automated DQ + Marketplace discovery"
   - "Collibra doesn't have this capability either"
   - "This is a 12+ month feature gap for competitors"

2. **Proven adoption at Farmers**
   - "You've invested in training 200 authors - switching costs $200K+ in productivity loss"
   - "350 active business users - biggest cost of switching is user re-training"
   - "Mark and Kumar have deep institutional knowledge of our platform"

3. **Cost advantage**
   - "OvalEdge delivers 40-50% lower TCO than Alation/Collibra enterprise licenses"
   - "Professional services rates 30% lower than competitor partners"

4. **Services commitment**
   - "We're proposing $556K in services - not just licensing"
   - "Investing in your success = strategic partnership, not vendor relationship"

5. **SaaS flexibility**
   - "Hybrid on-prem + SaaS strategy = no vendor lock-in"
   - "Phased migration = lower risk than competitors' approaches"

6. **Marketplace + AI governance alignment**
   - "2026 roadmap perfectly aligns with your #1 priority"
   - "Competitors are playing catch-up on these capabilities"

**If Ryan pushes on UI/UX**:
> "We hear 'clunky' feedback. Immediate response: (1) Advanced search training this month, (2) Custom dashboards deployed, (3) API enablement for power users, (4) 2026 UI/UX roadmap shared, (5) $75K advisory to co-create ideal experience. Can Alation match this responsiveness?"
