## COMPETITIVE DEFENSE (If Asked)

**"Why OvalEdge vs. Alation/Collibra?"**

1. **askEdgi is unique** — Conversational AI for DQ + Marketplace discovery (12-month feature gap vs. competitors)
2. **Proven adoption** — 200 trained authors, institutional knowledge, $200K+ switching cost
3. **Cost advantage** — 40-50% lower TCO than alternatives
4. **Services commitment** — $556K investment in their success (not just licensing)
5. **SaaS flexibility** — No vendor lock-in; hybrid on-prem/SaaS option
6. **2026 roadmap alignment** — Marketplace + AI governance = Priority #1

**If "clunky" UI mentioned:**
> "We hear that. Here's our response: (1) Advanced search training now, (2) Custom dashboards, (3) API enablement, (4) 2026 roadmap transparency, (5) $75K advisory to co-design ideal UX. Can Alation match this responsiveness?"

## RENEWAL DECISION FLOW

```
Mark Marshalek + Kumar (Operational Champions)
↓ Recommend "proceed"
↓
Ryan Niderno (CDO - Operational Approval)
↓ Validates strategic alignment
↓
Paul Wilson (COO) OR John Griek (CFO)
↓ Secures budget authority
↓
Raul Vargas (CEO)
↓ Final sign-off on transformation investment
↓
RENEWAL APPROVED + EXPANSION
```

**Our job**: Build consensus at Levels 1-2 so Levels 3-4 happen smoothly.

## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

**Q: "What if Ryan doesn't want to move fast?"**
A: New CDOs establish priorities in first 90 days. He respects OvalEdge (Travelers experience). Just need to show we listen to his priorities and move with pace.

**Q: "Why 90 days? December renewal is 10 months away."**
A: 90 days = today through May 3. That gives us momentum heading into summer. Renewal discussions start Aug-Sep. By then, we need asking EdGi pilot success + services credibility.

**Q: "What if pilot adoption is low?"**
A: That would be a red flag. Mitigation: Enhanced training + executive testimonials + use case showcase + quick pivot to new use cases.

**Q: "Should we discount to lock in renewal?"**
A: Not yet. Proof of concept first (askEdgi pilot, services delivery). By May, when they see results, they'll ask for faster expansion, not discounts.

**Q: "How do we handle Alation comparison?"**
A: Lead with askEdgi differentiation (unique capability). Show adoption proof (200 trained authors, 350 users). Position services as commitment to success.
