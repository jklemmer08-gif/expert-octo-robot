# Farmers Insurance Strategy Deck - Speaker Notes

## DELIVERY GUIDE

**Presentation Duration**: 30-45 minutes (depending on audience interaction)
**Optimal Setting**: Executive boardroom, executive sponsor + CSM present
**Audience**: OvalEdge leadership + internal CSM team
**Prep Time**: 15 minutes to review, 5 minutes to load deck

---

## OPENING (1 minute)

### What to Say

"Thank you all for carving out time today. We're here to talk about one of our most strategic opportunities in the insurance vertical—Farmers Insurance—and specifically, a critical 90-day window that will determine whether we capture $956K to $1.156M in expansion revenue while also strengthening our renewal position for December 2026.

This isn't just about license expansion. It's about positioning OvalEdge as the strategic data transformation partner for their CEO-backed initiative to become a 'true data culture organization.' And there's a sense of urgency here that I want to be very clear about from the start."

### Why This Opening Works
- **Quantifies opportunity immediately** (executives care about numbers first)
- **Creates urgency** (90-day window, December renewal deadline)
- **Frames it strategically** (not transactional, but transformational)
- **Sets agenda** (expansion + renewal, not either/or)

### Expected Reactions
- Heads will nod if they know Farmers well
- Note-taking will start if opportunity size resonates
- Someone may ask "Why are we just talking about this NOW?" (good sign they want to move fast)

## SLIDE 1: Executive Summary (5-7 minutes)

### Opening Transition
"Let me start with where we stand today and what's changed in the last week."

### Key Talking Points

**Account Snapshot Section:**
- "Farmers Insurance is a $14B P&C company with 21,000 employees. We've got strong adoption: 200 data engineers and stewards actively using OvalEdge, plus 350 business users who depend on our platform for data discovery and governance."
- "Current platform footprint: We're managing 2 DQ connectors. That's it. For a 21,000-person organization. That's our first expansion opportunity."
- "Health status is GREEN. Zero churn risk. Mark Marshalek and Kumar are both strong advocates. This account is not in danger."

**90-Day Critical Window:**
- "What's changed is NEW LEADERSHIP. On January 31st, we had a critical call with Ryan Niderno, their brand-new Chief Data Officer who just joined from Travelers. And here's what's important: Ryan actually has positive OvalEdge experience from his time at Travelers. He evaluated us against Alation and chose OvalEdge."
- "Ryan is now establishing Farmers' 2026 data priorities, and we have a narrow window—February through April—to ensure we're part of those conversations. If we don't engage Ryan and Kumar on their 2026 priorities in Q1, they'll set strategy without us. That window closes fast."

**New Leadership Context:**
- "Three people to know: Ryan Niderno (CDO, new, open to OvalEdge), Kumar (VP Analytics, our champion), and Mark Marshalek (Head of Data Governance, existing strong relationship). Plus Paul Wilson, the COO and former CIO—he's our target executive sponsor once we prove strategic value."
- "The CEO is backing this transformation. That means there's budget. That means there's executive air cover. That means we have runway."

**Total Opportunity Summary (Point at the numbers):**
- "$400K to $600K in license expansion—that's a 40-60% ARR increase on top of their current footprint."
- "Plus $556K in professional services TAM across 5 distinct business cases that directly map to their 2026 priorities."
- "Total: $956K to $1.156M over the next 9-12 months."

**Next 90 Days Preview:**
- "Here's what success looks like in 90 days: We've introduced Ryan to OvalEdge as a strategic partner. We've shown Kumar and Ryan that we understand their exact 2026 priorities. We've got a 50-user askEdgi pilot launching in April. We've locked in $248K in signed services. And we've got Paul Wilson as our executive sponsor ready to champion the renewal."

### How to Address Common Questions

**Q: "What if Ryan doesn't want to move fast?"**
A: "That's actually unlikely. New CDOs typically establish priorities in their first 90 days. If we're not at the table NOW, we're not in the priority conversation. We know he respects OvalEdge from Travelers, so we have credibility. We just need to show him we've listened to his 2026 priorities and built a plan that solves them."

**Q: "Why do we need all this services revenue?"**
A: "Two reasons. One, it's revenue—$556K is significant. Two, and more importantly, services revenue de-risks the license expansion. When we're investing $200K+ of our own professional services to help them succeed, we're proving we're committed to their success, not just their check. That commitment makes them more likely to expand AND more likely to renew."

**Q: "What's our main risk here?"**
A: "Our biggest risk is actually our biggest opportunity: Ryan is open to us but hasn't committed yet. If we don't engage him fast and show we understand his priorities, he'll likely run a competitive evaluation. We're mitigating that by moving FAST and by showing him askEdgi as a unique capability that Alation doesn't have."

### Slide Notes
- **Tone**: Confident but not arrogant. We're good, but we haven't won yet.
- **Pacing**: Spend 2 minutes on account snapshot (they probably know this), 2 minutes on the window urgency, 1 minute on leadership, 2 minutes explaining the numbers.
- **Visual cues**: Point at the $956K number. Let it sit for 2 seconds.

## SLIDE 2: SWOT Analysis (8-10 minutes)

### Opening Transition
"Now, let's be honest about where we stand. This is a real SWOT—not whitewashed. We have genuine strengths, real weaknesses, obvious opportunities, and legitimate threats."

### Key Talking Points

**STRENGTHS (Start Here - Build Confidence)**
- "First, the good news. Mark Marshalek is a rock-solid relationship. He trusts us. Kumar is actively advocating for us internally. We've got 200 trained authors and 350 active users—that's institutional knowledge and switching cost. When people use your product well, they don't want to switch."
- "Second, the NEW CDO advantage. Ryan came from Travelers where he already validated OvalEdge. He didn't choose us by accident—he chose us because he understood our value. That gives us credibility we wouldn't have with an external hire."
- "Third, massive expansion upside. Only 2 DQ connectors for a 21,000-person org is criminally underutilized. That's a 5-8x expansion opportunity in a module they already own. It's low-hanging fruit."
- "And fourth, product-market fit. Our askEdgi roadmap for AI-driven data quality and marketplace discovery aligns perfectly with what Ryan told us is Priority #1 and Priority #3. We're not selling them something they don't want."

**WEAKNESSES (Be Direct)**
- "Now, the challenges. Ryan is brand new to us. We have zero relationship history. That means we start from zero credibility, even though he likes OvalEdge conceptually. We need to earn that trust."
- "Second, they called our UI 'clunky.' That's not a small thing. That's leadership explicitly saying our product feels dated. We can't ignore that. We need to address it head-on and show them quick wins immediately."
- "Third, we haven't done professional services with them before. We have no track record of delivering advisory, so when we propose $556K in services, they don't yet believe we can deliver it. We need to start small (quick wins) and build trust through delivery."
- "And fourth, they want to move to SaaS. That's a customer priority we haven't positioned yet. Migration is complex, and if we don't handle it right, we sour the relationship."

**OPPORTUNITIES (Paint the Vision)**
- "Here's where it gets exciting. Ryan established an AI Council. He's CEO-backed. That's a governance opportunity—we can help design enterprise AI governance, position askEdgi as the cornerstone, and own a strategic seat at their AI decision table."
- "Marketplace sophistication is their #1 priority. That's a consulting opportunity where we design governance models, certification workflows, and subscription policies. That's strategic work where we're not just selling software—we're architecting their future state."
- "They had a data breach in August (1.1M customers exposed). That created PII discovery urgency. That's an automated DQ opportunity."
- "NAIC is bringing AI regulation to insurance in 2026. That means AI governance frameworks become compliance requirements, not nice-to-haves. We're positioned to help them get ahead of that."
- "CEO budget. Their CEO is backing this transformation. That's rare. It means budget is available. CEO programs don't get cut as easily as IT initiatives."
- "And finally, if we nail this—Marketplace + askEdgi + strategic positioning—we become the reference customer for the insurance vertical. That's long-term strategic value."

**THREATS (Acknowledge Reality)**
- "Competitive risk is real. Ryan compared us to Alation. That means he knows the alternative. We need to be proactive about differentiation, not defensive."
- "UI/UX feedback could escalate. If we don't address the 'clunky' comment quickly, it becomes a deal-blocker. We need visible progress within 4-6 weeks."
- "New leadership could reset vendor relationships. Ryan might have Alation champions in his network or in his mind. We can't assume we've won."
- "Budget uncertainty. CEO programs can get defunded if company priorities shift. Insurance industry is facing headwinds with rate environment."
- "SaaS migration risk. Complex migrations create frustration. If we mess this up, we damage the relationship."
- "And finally, the 90-day window closes. If we don't engage Ryan/Kumar in Q1, they'll make Q2 decisions without us."

**Key Insight Box:**
- Read this slowly: "Our biggest opportunity is ALSO our biggest threat. Ryan is genuinely interested in OvalEdge, but he hasn't committed. We have 90 days to prove we understand his priorities and can deliver on them. If we don't move NOW, we risk competitive evaluation."

### How to Address Common Questions

**Q: "Do we really have a weakness with UI/UX? Can't we just say the UI is fine?"**
A: "No. Ryan and Kumar both said it independently. That's not a rumor—that's customer feedback from leadership. If we dismiss it, we lose credibility. If we acknowledge it and show quick wins (better search, custom dashboards, API enablement), we regain credibility AND show we listen. Honesty is more powerful than defense."

**Q: "Is the SaaS migration really a threat?"**
A: "It's a threat if we don't prepare for it properly. But if we staff it well, plan it carefully, and deliver flawlessly, it becomes an opportunity. A successful migration cements the relationship because we're the vendor they trust during a risky transition."

### Slide Notes
- **Tone**: Honest and strategic. We're not afraid of the weaknesses and threats because we have a plan to mitigate them.
- **Pacing**: 2 min on strengths, 2 min on weaknesses, 2 min on opportunities, 1 min on threats, 1 min on key insight.
- **Visual cues**: When you read the Key Insight, slow down. Let them absorb the tension between opportunity and threat.

## SLIDE 3: TAM & Services Opportunity (10-15 minutes)

### Opening Transition
"Okay, so we've identified the strategic opportunity. Now let's get specific about WHERE the money is. This is where we show we've listened to their priorities and built service offerings that solve real problems."

### Key Talking Points

**Header - Set Expectations:**
- "Beyond the 40-60% license expansion—which is $400K to $600K—Farmers represents $556K in professional services and advisory tied directly to the 2026 priorities we heard from Ryan and Kumar. These aren't invented services. These are solutions to problems they explicitly told us they have."

**BUSINESS CASE 1: AI Governance Framework ($131K)**

Opening: "Let's start with the biggest service engagement: AI Governance Framework."

Talking Points:
- "They established an AI Council. They're running ML models in production (wildfire risk scoring, usage-based insurance pricing). They need governance to ensure those models are compliant, auditable, and ethical."
- "NAIC regulation is coming in 2026. That means AI governance becomes a compliance requirement, not a nice-to-have. We can help them build that framework now, so they're ahead of regulation."
- "This breaks into two phases: Framework Design (8-12 weeks, $64K) and Implementation (12-16 weeks, $67K)."
- "Phase 1: We do a governance maturity assessment, design their framework, document policies, do a gap analysis against NAIC requirements."
- "Phase 2: We help them deploy askEdgi as the AI lineage and PII discovery engine, train the AI Council on quarterly governance, and certify stewards."
- "Success looks like: NAIC compliance readiness, AI Council NPS of 70+, askEdgi adoption at 80%."
- "Why this matters: This positions askEdgi as the strategic tool for AI governance. It locks them into asking EdGi for every AI model governance question. That's a license expansion driver."

**BUSINESS CASE 2: Marketplace Governance ($101.5K)**

Opening: "Priority #1 from Ryan and Kumar: Marketplace sophistication. They want reusable data products, certification workflows, subscription models."

Talking Points:
- "Most organizations don't have governance around data products. They publish data. Consumers find it. That's it. But Ryan wants MORE: certified products, subscription models (this product costs $X to produce, so teams that use it pay $Y), quality tiers."
- "We design that governance. We workshop with them. We identify what data products should be certified. We design workflows. We build the policies."
- "This is consulting work where we're not selling features—we're selling strategy. That's higher value than implementation."
- "Timeline: Discovery & Design (6-8 weeks, $47.5K), Implementation & Training (8-10 weeks, $30K), Quarterly Advisory (12 months, $24K)."
- "Success metrics: 50+ certified data products, 80% consumer satisfaction, 30% reduction in duplicate/unnecessary data requests."
- "Why this matters: This makes Marketplace OUR product in their eyes, not someone else's. It creates consulting dependency that extends beyond the service engagement."

**BUSINESS CASE 3: SaaS Transition ($99.5K)**

Opening: "They explicitly told us they want to move from on-prem to reduce technical complexity. This is a priority, and it's also a risk if we don't handle it right."

Talking Points:
- "Migrations are painful. Teams worry about data loss. Users worry about disruption. We need to de-risk this by being their trusted advisor for planning and execution."
- "We break it into three phases: Planning (4-6 weeks, $25K), Execution (6-8 weeks, $42.5K), Change Management (4-6 weeks, $32K)."
- "Planning: Readiness assessment, migration runbook, risk mitigation."
- "Execution: Data/metadata migration, testing, cutover support."
- "Change Management: User comms, training for 200 authors, 30-day hypercare period where we're on call."
- "Why this matters: This is a relationship cement. When we guide them through a risky migration and deliver flawlessly, they trust us for everything else."

**BUSINESS CASE 4: UI/UX Advisory ($75K)**

Opening: "They called our UI 'clunky.' Instead of getting defensive, we say: 'Let's fix it together.'"

Talking Points:
- "This is not us telling them the UI is fine. It's us saying: Here's what power users are struggling with. Here's a roadmap to address it. Here's advanced features they don't know about (advanced search, API, custom dashboards). Let's train people on those RIGHT NOW as quick wins, and let's build a roadmap together for what you want to see in 2026."
- "Quick wins (Weeks 3-4): Advanced search training, API enablement training, custom dashboard configuration."
- "These are high-impact activities that address 'clunky' immediately and show we listen."
- "Ongoing: Quarterly UX optimization reviews where we sit with their teams and iterate on improvements."
- "Cost: $75K total. $23K for assessment, $20K for quick wins, $32K for ongoing quarterly reviews."
- "Why this matters: Addressing the UX concern head-on prevents it from becoming a deal-blocker. It shows we're responsive. It moves us from 'vendor' to 'partner.'"

**BUSINESS CASE 5: DQ Expansion ($149K)**

Opening: "Remember those 2 DQ connectors? Ryan explicitly prioritized automated DQ checks. We can take them from 2 to 10 connectors and deploy 500+ automated DQ rules."

Talking Points:
- "They want automated quality checking. Currently they have 2 connectors. We identify the 5-8 highest-priority data sources and implement DQ connectors for those."
- "This isn't just plumbing. We design which quality rules matter for each source. We set up dashboards. We train stewards on how to respond to DQ issues."
- "Timeline: Assessment (3-4 weeks, $37.5K), Implementation (12-16 weeks, $76K), Training & Optimization (6-8 weeks, $35.5K)."
- "Success metrics: 10 live connectors, 500+ automated rules, 80% detection rate, 60% reduction in incidents."
- "Why this matters: This is the operational pillar that makes their data culture real. Quality data is the foundation. When they see incidents drop 60%, they see value."

**TAM Summary Table:**
- Walk through each row. Stop on the total.
- "$556K in services, all directly tied to their 2026 priorities."
- "Conservative scenario (60% close rate): $334K services + $400K license = $734K total."
- "Optimistic scenario (80% close rate): $445K services + $600K license = $1.045M total."

**Key Insight:**
- "Services revenue de-risks license expansion. When we're investing $200K+ of professional services alongside their license purchase, we're saying we're committed to their success. That confidence translates to them committing to us."

### How to Address Common Questions

**Q: "These service rates seem high. Are consultants really worth $2,500/day?"**
A: "Yes, for this type of strategic consulting. We're not staffing junior resources. These are senior folks who understand governance, architecture, and transformation. Compare to Big 4 consulting ($3,000-$5,000/day). We're competitive AND we have product credibility they don't. Plus, these rates are assumptions—we customize to our actual delivery team rates."

**Q: "Can we really do all 5 business cases?"**
A: "We're not saying we do all 5 simultaneously. This is a waterfall over 9-12 months. We start with Marketplace Governance (Week 3-6), layer in askEdgi/AI Governance (Weeks 5-8), launch DQ and SaaS work (Weeks 7-10). We pace it based on their bandwidth and our delivery capacity."

**Q: "What if they don't want services?"**
A: "That's possible. But notice: Most of their 2026 priorities (Marketplace governance, AI governance framework, SaaS migration) require advisory. They won't build these themselves. So either they hire us, or they hire a Big 4 firm or a boutique consulting firm. Our advantage is product credibility. We understand our platform deeply. We should own this."

### Slide Notes
- **Tone**: Confident and detailed. You're showing you've done homework.
- **Pacing**: Spend 2-3 min per business case explaining the problem, solution, and why it matters. 1 min on TAM summary. 30 sec on key insight.
- **Visual cues**: When you show the TAM table, point at the $556K number and the $1.156M total opportunity. These numbers should stick with the audience.

## SLIDE 4: Org Chart & Engagement Strategy (8-10 minutes)

### Opening Transition
"Now we've got the opportunity mapped. Let's talk about WHO we need to influence and HOW we're going to engage them. This is the relationship strategy."

### Key Talking Points

**Decision Authority Hierarchy - Explain the Flow:**
- "Here's how decisions flow at Farmers. Budget comes from Raul Vargas (CEO) and John Griek (CFO). Operational decisions come through Ryan Niderno (the new CDO). But Paul Wilson, the COO and former CIO, is THE lever. He understands both IT and business. If Paul champions this, he can unlock budget and executive air cover."
- "Below Ryan, we have Kumar (VP Analytics) and Mark Marshalek (Head of Data Governance). They're the operational champions who actually use our platform and advocate internally."
- "Then we have 200 trained authors, 350 business users, and teams managing DQ connectors. These are the people who generate adoption metrics and user NPS."

**Relationship Status - Color-Coded:**
- "Let's be explicit about where we stand."
- "STRONG (Green): Mark Marshalek. We've got trust history. Kumar is here too—he's actively advocating. We should leverage both of them for the Ryan introduction."
- "DEVELOPING (Yellow): Ryan Niderno. This is our critical gap. He's open to us based on Travelers experience, but we have zero relationship history. This is Week 1-2 priority."
- "PRIORITY TARGETS (Red): Paul Wilson (not yet engaged, but high-value), AI Council (needs alignment on askEdgi)."

**Renewal Decision Flow - Walk Through It:**
1. "Mark and Kumar (operational champions) say 'This is good, move forward.'"
2. "Ryan (CDO) validates strategic alignment and gives operational blessing."
3. "Paul or John (executive level) secures budget."
4. "Raul (CEO) signs off on the data transformation investment."
- "Our job is to build consensus at steps 1 and 2 so step 3 and 4 happen smoothly."

**90-Day Engagement Milestones - This is the PLAN:**
- "Week 1-2: Ryan intro call via warm introduction from Mark or Kumar. Goal: Establish relationship, understand his style, identify his top 2-3 pain points."
- "Week 3-4: Joint session with Ryan and Kumar on Marketplace governance. Goal: Show we've listened to his priorities and have a plan."
- "Week 5-8: askEdgi demo to AI Council. Goal: Executive alignment on AI governance, initial enthusiasm for enterprise rollout."
- "Week 9-12: Paul Wilson executive briefing. Goal: Position Paul as executive sponsor, get his commitment to renewal governance."

**Key Relationship Insights:**
- "Mark Marshalek is our strongest relationship. He's our door opener."
- "Kumar is our new champion. Strengthen that relationship relentlessly."
- "Ryan is our critical gap. Everything hinges on Week 1-2 execution."
- "AI Council composition is unknown. We need that list from Ryan so we can prep the demo."

### How to Address Common Questions

**Q: "What if Mark won't facilitate the Ryan intro?"**
A: "Mark will. He's an OvalEdge champion. Plus, he reports to Ryan now (Data Governance reports to CDO). He has incentive to make sure his CDO understands OvalEdge. If for some reason he won't, we go through Kumar instead."

**Q: "What's our plan if Paul Wilson says 'no'?"**
A: "We don't need Paul to say yes immediately. We just need him to be curious. We show him data: askEdgi pilot results (80%+ activation, NPS 60+), signed services SOWs ($248K+), positive customer feedback. By May, Paul should be saying 'This makes sense.' If he's not, we've got bigger problems, and we'll know it by Week 10."

**Q: "Should we try to connect directly with Ryan, or go through Mark?"**
A: "Go through Mark or Kumar for the intro. Direct outreach to Ryan at this stage feels like we're bypassing the relationship network. Mark/Kumar intro shows respect for their relationship and their organization. Plus, a warm intro has 10x better results than cold outreach."

### Slide Notes
- **Tone**: Tactical and relationship-focused. You're showing people understand political dynamics.
- **Pacing**: 2 min on decision hierarchy, 2 min on relationship status, 1.5 min on decision flow, 2 min on 90-day milestones, 1 min on key insights.
- **Visual cues**: When you show the org chart, trace the decision flow with your finger. Show people how decision authority flows.

## SLIDE 5: 90-Day Execution Roadmap (12-15 minutes)

### Opening Transition
"Okay, here's where the rubber meets the road. This is the week-by-week plan for the next 90 days. Specificity matters here. Vagueness loses momentum."

### Key Talking Points

**Header - Set Stakes:**
- "10 months to December 2026 renewal, but the next 90 days are CRITICAL. New CDO Ryan is setting priorities RIGHT NOW. If we're not at that table in Q1, decisions get made without us. This window closes fast."

**WEEKS 1-2: RYAN ENGAGEMENT (URGENT)**

Opening: "Week 1-2 is about establishing relationship with Ryan. This is the highest priority because everything else depends on it."

Talking Points:
- "ACTION 1: Ryan Intro Call (Feb 10 deadline)."
  - "Owner: Naga (TAM) + Jack (CSM). Jack because he has relationship with Mark/Kumar."
  - "Approach: Warm intro. Mark or Kumar makes the introduction to Ryan."
  - "Agenda: We listen more than we talk. 'Ryan, congratulations on joining Farmers. We've worked with Mark and Kumar for a while and respect your Travelers background. Tell us what you're thinking about for data in 2026. We want to make sure we understand your priorities and see if there's a fit.' That's it."
  - "Success: Ryan agrees to quarterly partnership reviews. He identifies 2-3 pain points."
  - "Why: We're not pitching. We're listening. That builds credibility."

- "ACTION 2: Kumar Deep-Dive (Feb 13 deadline)."
  - "Owner: Naga."
  - "Goal: Get Kumar's read on Ryan's style, his actual priorities, his decision-making process, his relationship with the CFO."
  - "This is where we do homework. Kumar knows Ryan's mind better than Ryan knows us."
  - "Success: Kumar advocates for OvalEdge to Ryan. We get organizational insights."

- "ACTION 3: Mark Marshalek Org Chart Validation (Feb 16 deadline)."
  - "Owner: Naga."
  - "Goal: Confirm who's on the AI Council, who reports to whom, who has budget authority."
  - "This is data gathering. We need a complete picture before we pitch anything."
  - "Success: Updated org chart, AI Council member list, budget process documented."

**WEEKS 3-6: QUICK WINS & PILOTS**

Opening: "Now that we know Ryan, we need to DEMONSTRATE value on his priorities. This is where we show, not tell."

Talking Points:
- "ACTION 4: Marketplace Governance Workshop (Mar 8 deadline)."
  - "2-day executive session with Ryan, Kumar, Mark, plus data product owners from their business."
  - "Owner: Naga + Solutions Architect."
  - "What happens: We bring a POV on what marketplace governance should look like. They tell us their vision. We align. We co-design."
  - "Outcome: $101K Marketplace governance consulting proposal walks out of the room."
  - "Success: Verbal commitment. 3-5 data products identified as pilot candidates."
  - "Why: This is consulting at a strategic level. We're not implementing features. We're architecting their future state. That's high-value."

- "ACTION 5: UI/UX Quick Win (Feb 24 deadline)."
  - "2-hour power-user training. Advanced search, API enablement, custom dashboards."
  - "Owner: Jack (CSM) + Pradip (GE)."
  - "Attendees: Ryan, Kumar, Mark, any power users they want to include."
  - "Why: Address 'clunky' immediately. Show responsiveness. Build quick confidence."
  - "Success: 80% attendee satisfaction. 3+ people actively using power features within 2 weeks."
  - "This is the 'quick win' that prevents UI/UX from becoming a deal-blocker."

- "ACTION 6: askEdgi Pilot Proposal (Mar 1 deadline)."
  - "50 users. 60-day pilot. April 1 launch."
  - "Owner: Naga + askEdgi PM."
  - "Scope: Ryan's team, Kumar's team, AI Council members. All using askEdgi for automated DQ + marketplace discovery."
  - "Why 50 users: Big enough to prove value. Small enough to manage pilot risk. 60 days = long enough to see adoption, short enough to iterate."
  - "Success: Pilot proposal approved. Launch date locked. Users identified."
  - "This is the UNIQUE offering. Alation doesn't have askEdgi. This is where we differentiate."

- "ACTION 7: DQ Expansion Assessment (Mar 10 deadline)."
  - "Workshop: Which data sources have the highest quality risk? Where should we focus first?"
  - "Owner: Pradip (GE) + DQ PM."
  - "Outcome: $149K DQ expansion services proposal. Roadmap for 5-8 new connectors."
  - "Success: Agreement to add 5+ connectors in 2026. SOW drafted."
  - "Why: This is operational value. When they see quality issues drop 60%, they see ROI."

**WEEKS 7-10: EXECUTIVE SPONSORSHIP & LAUNCH**

Opening: "By Week 7, we should have momentum. Three things happen: Paul Wilson comes on board as sponsor, askEdgi pilot launches, and we're positioned for renewal."

Talking Points:
- "ACTION 8: Paul Wilson Executive Briefing (Mar 30 deadline)."
  - "30-minute conversation. Not a dog-and-pony show. Strategic conversation."
  - "Owner: VP Customer Success + Naga (so Naga can speak to opportunity, VPCS speaks to relationship)."
  - "Message: 'Paul, we've been working with Mark and Kumar on their data governance roadmap for the past couple months. Ryan has set an ambitious 2026 priority around data transformation and AI governance. We want to be the strategic partner for that. Here's what we're seeing, here's where we can add value, and here's what we're recommending. We'd like you as executive sponsor so we can move this forward in a coordinated way.'"
  - "Success: Paul becomes sponsor. Commits to quarterly partnership reviews."
  - "Why: COOs care about transformational outcomes and execution risk. Position this as both. We're not just selling software. We're helping them transform into a data-driven organization."

- "ACTION 9: askEdgi Pilot Launch (Apr 1 deadline - THIS IS LIVE)."
  - "50 users. April 1 through May 31."
  - "Owner: Jack (CSM) + askEdgi PM."
  - "Success metrics: 80% activation (40+ users actively using), 10+ queries per user per week, NPS 60+, 3+ executive testimonials."
  - "Why this matters: This is proof of concept. When Ryan sees 40 people using askEdgi daily and asking 500+ queries per week, that's tangible value. That makes him believe the enterprise rollout is possible."

- "ACTION 10: AI Council askEdgi Demo (Mar 25 deadline)."
  - "45-minute demo focused on AI governance."
  - "Owner: Naga + Solutions Architect."
  - "Audience: AI Council members."
  - "Focus: AI model lineage, PII discovery, automated governance."
  - "Outcome: $131K AI Governance Framework proposal walks out."
  - "Success: Council requests enterprise rollout. Consulting scoped."
  - "Why: The AI Council cares about compliance, model transparency, PII protection. Show them askEdgi solves all three."

- "ACTION 11: SaaS Transition Planning Kickoff (Apr 5 deadline)."
  - "Readiness assessment. Timeline. Hypercare plan."
  - "Owner: Pradip (GE) + Professional Services."
  - "Outcome: $99.5K SaaS migration services SOW signed."
  - "Success: Migration timeline agreed (Q3). SOW signed. Resource plan confirmed."
  - "Why: Get commitment NOW while enthusiasm is high. Once contracts are signed, they're invested."

**WEEKS 11-13: RENEWAL PREP**

Opening: "By Week 11, we're in the home stretch. We have pilots running. Services are signed. Now we document the renewal opportunity and get executive alignment."

Talking Points:
- "ACTION 12: Q1 QBR (Apr 20 deadline)."
  - "Attendees: Ryan, Kumar, Mark, Paul Wilson, ideally CFO."
  - "Agenda: Q1 recap. How many people are using askEdgi? What's the NPS? What's the early ROI? What's the services roadmap? What's the renewal opportunity?"
  - "Success: QBR NPS 80+. Verbal renewal commitment. CFO asks about budget process."
  - "This is the turning point. After this QBR, renewal should feel inevitable to them."

- "ACTION 13: Renewal Business Case Documentation (Apr 25 deadline)."
  - "Internal document (for OvalEdge leadership first)."
  - "Content: Current state (200 authors, 350 users, 2 connectors). Proposed expansion (askEdgi 350-500, DQ 2→10, Authors 200→250). Services value ($248K+ signed, $307K pipeline). ROI. Investment ask."
  - "Success: Approved by OvalEdge leadership. Ready for customer presentation."
  - "Why: We need to know OUR number before we present to them."

- "ACTION 14: CFO Introduction (May 1 deadline)."
  - "Only if needed. By this point, CFO might already be in."
  - "Message: 'John, we've worked with your team over the past quarter on their data transformation roadmap. We're excited about the progress and want to make sure you understand the investment we're recommending and the expected ROI.'"
  - "Success: CFO verbal commitment to renewal budget."

**Summary - Bring It Home:**
- "That's 90 days. 14 actions. Specific deadlines. Clear owners. Measurable success criteria."
- "If we execute this plan, on May 3rd we should have: Ryan as a strategic partner, Kumar still advocating, Paul as executive sponsor, $248K in signed services, $307K in proposed services, askEdgi pilot showing strong early results, and renewal confidence at 85%+."

### How to Address Common Questions

**Q: "This is a lot of meetings. Will they have the bandwidth?"**
A: "Ryan just arrived. He's setting priorities. He'll MAKE time for this. Plus, these aren't frivolous meetings. Marketplace Governance Workshop? That's strategic for them. askEdgi demo? That's on their priority list. Paul Wilson brief? That's executive sponsorship. They won't push back on these because they align with their priorities."

**Q: "What if someone misses a deadline?"**
A: "We adjust. But we don't skip. If the Marketplace Workshop has to move from Mar 8 to Mar 15, we move it. If Paul Wilson can't meet until Apr 10, we move it. The sequence is flexible, but the outcomes aren't. We need to lock in 4 things by end of Q1: Ryan relationship, askEdgi pilot approval, Services proposals ($248K+), and Paul as sponsor. Those timelines matter."

**Q: "Should we brief OvalEdge leadership on this plan?"**
A: "Yes. In fact, you should show them this slide. Say: 'Here's our 90-day plan. Here's what we're committing to. Here's how we'll measure success. We'll update you every 2 weeks.' That creates accountability and gives you cover if you need resources."

### Slide Notes
- **Tone**: Structured, specific, and ambitious. You're showing discipline.
- **Pacing**: Spend 3-4 min on Weeks 1-2 (it's critical), 3-4 min on Weeks 3-6 (momentum building), 3 min on Weeks 7-10 (execution), 2 min on Weeks 11-13 (closing), 1 min on summary.
- **Visual cues**: When you read deadlines, emphasize them. "Feb 10. Feb 13. Feb 16. Those are hard dates." That focuses the room.

## SLIDE 6: Risk Mitigation & Competitive Defense (10-12 minutes)

### Opening Transition
"Now, we've got an aggressive plan. But we'd be naive to ignore risks. Let's talk about what could go wrong and how we mitigate it."

### Key Talking Points

**RISK 1: Competitive Evaluation (Alation/Collibra)**

Opening: "Ryan evaluated Alation at Travelers. He might do it again here. Let's be proactive."

Talking Points:
- "Likelihood: 40% (Medium). Impact: HIGH. If Ryan runs a competitive eval, it delays renewal, creates pricing pressure, and gives Alation a seat at the table."
- **Mitigation 1 (Week 1-2):** "Proactive differentiation in the first call with Ryan. Don't wait for him to ask. Lead with this: 'Ryan, we know Alation is good. You evaluated them at Travelers. But here's what we have that they don't: askEdgi. Conversational AI for automated DQ and marketplace discovery. That's not a feature parity thing. That's a 12-month capability gap.' Then show him the roadmap."
- **Mitigation 2 (Week 3-6):** "Ask EdGi pilot. Real usage data beats any pitch. When 40 people are querying askEdgi daily, that's the best defense against alternatives."
- **Mitigation 3 (Week 3-13):** "Services lock-in. Every SOW we sign creates switching cost. If we sign Marketplace Governance ($101K), DQ Expansion ($149K), and SaaS Migration ($99.5K), that's $349K invested in their success. Ripping out OvalEdge now costs them money AND disruption."
- **Success Criteria:** "No RFP issued by Q2 end. Ryan verbally commits: 'Not evaluating alternatives.'"
- **Talking Point to Use:** "'Ryan, when you were at Travelers, you evaluated us and chose us. We want to prove that was the right decision. Let's lock in a pilot and some services, and let's revisit this conversation in 90 days. If we're not delivering, we can reassess. But I think by May, you'll be confident we're the right partner.'"

**RISK 2: UI/UX Escalation**

Opening: "They called our UI 'clunky.' That's a complaint, not a death sentence. But if we ignore it, it becomes a deal-blocker."

Talking Points:
- "Likelihood: 30% (Medium). Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH. If 'clunky' becomes an escalated complaint, it justifies a competitive eval."
- **Mitigation 1 (Week 3-4):** "Immediate quick win. Feb 24 training on advanced search, API, custom dashboards. Show them the platform can do more than they think. Don't wait for a 2026 product roadmap. Show value NOW."
- **Mitigation 2 (Week 3-6):** "Product roadmap transparency. Share what's coming in 2026 for UI/UX. Invite power users to beta. Make them feel heard."
- **Mitigation 3 (Week 3-6):** "API enablement. Power users who understand our API can build workarounds and extensions. That's a way to unblock them while we improve the UI."
- **Mitigation 4 (Week 7-10):** "$75K UI/UX Advisory. Co-create the ideal UX with them. They're not sitting on the sidelines. They're designing it WITH us. That's powerful."
- **Success Criteria:** "User NPS improves +20 points by Q2 end. 'Clunky' feedback disappears from conversations."
- **Talking Point to Use:** "'We hear the UI feedback. Here's what we're doing about it: (1) Training on power features today, (2) Roadmap transparency, (3) $75K advisory engagement to co-create ideal experience. Can Alation match this responsiveness? We're not just selling software. We're partnering on the experience.'"

**RISK 3: Budget Cuts / CEO Program Defunding**

Opening: "CEO programs are exciting, but they're also vulnerable. Market shifts, priorities change, budgets get cut. We need to insulate ourselves."

Talking Points:
- "Likelihood: 15% (Low). Impact: VERY HIGH. If the CEO program gets defunded, renewal could be at risk."
- **Mitigation 1 (Week 1-13):** "CEO transformation narrative. Every conversation ties back to the CEO's vision of a 'true data culture organization.' That's not OUR pitch. That's THEIR strategic direction. We're enabling it, not imposing it. That makes us less vulnerable to budget cuts because we're supporting the CEO's priority, not a single C-suite advocate."
- **Mitigation 2 (Week 7-10):** "ROI documentation. Quantify the value. 'Your compliance team spends X hours on manual DQ. Automated DQ cuts that by 60%. That's $Y saved. Your data team spends X hours building governance. We design it for you. That's $Z in productivity saved.' When budget cuts happen, the CFO asks: 'What's the ROI?' We have an answer."
- **Mitigation 3 (Q2 Proposal):** "Multi-year discount. Offer them a 2-3 year contract at a discount. Once it's signed, it's harder to cut. Plus, multi-year signals confidence and commitment."
- **Mitigation 4 (Ongoing):** "Macro trend monitoring. Insurance industry is facing headwinds. If you see signals of trouble, be proactive. Call Paul Wilson. Say: 'We're seeing some headwinds in the industry. Let's make sure we're ready.' Show you understand their business."
- **Success Criteria:** "Multi-year renewal secured. No budget cut discussions by May."

**RISK 4: SaaS Migration Complexity**

Opening: "SaaS migrations are inherently risky. Data gets lost. Users get frustrated. We need to de-risk this proactively."

Talking Points:
- "Likelihood: 35% (Medium). Impact: MEDIUM. A failed migration doesn't kill the renewal, but it definitely sours the relationship."
- **Mitigation 1 (Week 7-10):** "$99.5K professional services SOW. We staff a dedicated migration team. We're not asking them to figure it out. We're handling it. That's the de-risking."
- **Mitigation 2 (Q2-Q3):** "Phased approach. Don't do a big-bang cutover. Migrate non-critical systems first. Run parallel for a period. Then cut over critical systems. That spreads risk."
- **Mitigation 3 (Q2-Q3):** "30-day hypercare period. After cutover, we're available 24/7 (practically speaking) for 30 days. Any issues, we jump on them. That prevents small issues from becoming big issues."
- **Mitigation 4 (Q2-Q3):** "Change management. User communication plan. Training program. Weekly steering committee updates so executives are informed and problems get solved fast."
- **Success Criteria:** "SaaS migration on-time. Zero data loss. Zero critical outages. <5% user disruption. 90% satisfaction."
- **Talking Point to Use:** "'We understand SaaS migrations are risky. We've done them. Here's our approach: Phased methodology. Dedicated team. Hypercare period. Weekly steering committee updates. By May, you'll be running SaaS with confidence.'"

**COMPETITIVE DEFENSE TALKING POINTS**

Opening: "Now, if Ryan pushes back or compares us to alternatives, here's how we respond."

Talking Points:
- **"Why OvalEdge vs. Alation/Collibra?"**
  1. "askEdgi is unique. Alation doesn't have conversational AI for automated DQ + marketplace discovery. That's a 12-month feature gap."
  2. "Proven adoption. You've trained 200 authors. You've built institutional knowledge. Switching costs $200K+ in productivity loss plus re-training effort."
  3. "Cost advantage. OvalEdge is 40-50% lower TCO than Alation/Collibra enterprise licenses."
  4. "Services commitment. We're proposing $556K in services. That's not just licensing. That's investing in your success."
  5. "SaaS flexibility. Hybrid on-prem + SaaS. No vendor lock-in. Competitors are all-in on SaaS."
  6. "2026 roadmap alignment. Marketplace + AI governance + automated DQ. Your priorities. We're aligned. Competitors are catching up."

- **If Ryan pushes on UI/UX:**
  - "We hear 'clunky' feedback. Immediate response: (1) Advanced search training, (2) Custom dashboards, (3) API enablement, (4) 2026 roadmap, (5) $75K advisory to co-design ideal UX. Can Alation respond that quickly? We listen. We act. We iterate."

**Overall Renewal Risk Assessment - Show the Table:**
- "Competitive evaluation: Low-Medium risk (25%). Mitigated by askEdgi + services."
- "UI/UX escalation: Medium risk (30%). Mitigated by quick wins + advisory."
- "Budget defunding: Low risk (15%). Mitigated by CEO narrative + ROI."
- "SaaS migration issues: Medium risk (35%). Mitigated by professional services + phased approach."
- "Overall churn risk: LOW-MEDIUM (25%). If we execute the plan, we reduce that to 10% or less."

**BOTTOM LINE - This Is the Close:**
- "If we execute this 90-day plan successfully, renewal confidence is 85%+."
- "Here's what we're committing to:"
  1. "Engage Ryan fast (Week 1-2)"
  2. "Demonstrate value on HIS priorities (Weeks 3-6)"
  3. "Lock in services ($248K+ signed by Week 13)"
  4. "Secure Paul Wilson sponsorship (Weeks 7-10)"
  5. "Launch askEdgi pilot successfully (Week 9+)"
- "If we do those five things, renewal is not a question. It's a conversation about expansion."

### How to Address Common Questions

**Q: "Aren't we being too optimistic about 85% renewal confidence?"**
A: "Not if we execute. Here's why: Mark likes us. Kumar advocates for us. Ryan respects us from Travelers. We're solving his top priorities. We're investing $200K+ in his success. Unless there's a massive company crisis (layoffs, sale, strategic shift), renewal should happen. 85% assumes we do our job well."

**Q: "What if Paul Wilson won't become sponsor?"**
A: "Then we escalate risk from 25% to 40%. But honestly, if Paul won't become sponsor, it means he doesn't see strategic value. And if Paul—a former CIO who understands IT—doesn't see value, then maybe we have a bigger problem. That said, Paul will become sponsor if we give him proof of concept. askEdgi pilot results + signed services + customer testimonials = proof of concept."

**Q: "Should we be worried about the CFO?"**
A: "Not yet. CFOs care about ROI and budget. If we can show both, CFOs are allies. John Griek isn't a threat. He's a gate. Once we prove ROI, the gate opens."

### Slide Notes
- **Tone**: Confident and prepared. You've thought about what could go wrong, and you have answers.
- **Pacing**: 2-3 min per risk, 1 min on defense talking points, 1 min on overall risk, 1 min on bottom line.
- **Visual cues**: When you get to bottom line, slow down. This is what they should remember.

## CLOSING (2-3 minutes)

### What to Say

"Okay, let me wrap this up. Here's what we're asking for:

1. **Commitment to the plan.** This 90-day roadmap only works if we execute. That means Naga is owned on Ryan relationship. Jack is owned on pilot launch. Pradip is owned on services delivery. We need accountability.

2. **Resource support.** We're proposing $556K in services. That requires delivery resources. We need to plan for Solutions Architects, data quality folks, professional services folks. Let's make sure we have bandwidth.

3. **Executive alignment.** We need OvalEdge leadership (VPs of CS, Product, etc.) aligned on this plan and available to join key customer calls (Paul Wilson brief, CEO QBR, etc.).

4. **Speed.** This window is 90 days. If we're slow, if we push meetings, if we deprioritize, we lose momentum. Ryan is setting priorities NOW. Let's be fast.

If we get those four things, I'm confident in 85%+ renewal confidence and $956K-$1.156M in expansion opportunity.

Questions?"

### Why This Close Works
- **Specific asks** (not vague)
- **Ownership clarity** (people know what they're responsible for)
- **Resource transparency** (we're not underselling effort)
- **Speed focus** (emphasizes urgency without being panic-y)
- **Final confidence statement** (ends on a high note)

## Q&A STRATEGY

### Common Questions You'll Get

**Q: "What if Ryan leaves or changes roles?"**
A: "That would be a setback, but not a death blow. We've also got Mark and Kumar. If Ryan exits and is replaced by someone else, we'd need to reset that relationship. But we're not hanging everything on Ryan. We're building stakeholder consensus across multiple people."

**Q: "How do we actually close the askEdgi pilot into expansion?"**
A: "During the pilot (Apr-May), we track adoption metrics religiously. At pilot end (May 31), we show them: 40+ users, 500+ weekly queries, NPS 60+, 3+ exec testimonials. Then we say: 'You've validated askEdgi works. Now let's rollout to 350 users.' That's not a 'sell' at that point. That's a natural extension of a successful pilot."

**Q: "What if they say 'We want to evaluate other vendors'?"**
A: "We don't panic. We say: 'That's fair. Here's what we recommend: Let's run the askEdgi pilot for 60 days. Let's sign the Marketplace Governance SOW. Let's get Paul Wilson as sponsor. Then in May, if you still want to evaluate alternatives, we'll understand. But we think by May, you'll be confident we're the right partner.' Basically, we use pilot success as the proof point."

**Q: "Should we discount pricing to lock in the deal?"**
A: "Not yet. We haven't even proven value. Discounting now is a mistake. Proof of concept first (askEdgi pilot, services delivery), THEN negotiate pricing if needed. By May, when they see results, they won't ask for discounts. They'll ask for faster expansion."

## DELIVERY TIPS

### Before You Present
1. **Practice out loud.** Don't just read the slides. Tell the story conversationally.
2. **Time yourself.** Aim for 30-45 minutes + Q&A. Know where you can trim if needed.
3. **Load the deck.** Test it in the room beforehand. Nothing worse than technical issues killing momentum.
4. **Bring handouts.** Print out the TAM tables and org chart. Executives like to take notes.
5. **Pre-brief key people.** Call Naga before the meeting. Make sure he's ready for questions on TAM. Call Jack. Make sure he's ready for questions on execution.

### During the Presentation
1. **Stand.** Don't sit. Own the room.
2. **Slow down on numbers.** When you show $956K-$1.156M, pause. Let it sink in.
3. **Make eye contact.** Look at the executive sponsor (whoever invited you). Make sure they're tracking.
4. **Invite questions.** "Does this make sense so far?" pulls them into the conversation.
5. **Anchor on risks.** Don't oversell. Be honest about weaknesses and risks. That credibility will carry you further than hype.

### After the Presentation
1. **Get action items.** "Who's owning the Ryan intro? When's it happening?" Lock it down.
2. **Schedule next check-in.** "Let's reconvene on Feb 12 to review Week 1-2 progress." Keeps momentum.
3. **Send follow-up.** Deck + speaker notes + key contacts + success metrics. Make it easy to reference.
4. **Weekly updates.** Every Friday, send a 1-page update on progress. Keeps executives informed without overwhelming them.

---

## KEY TAKEAWAYS TO REMEMBER

1. **90 days is a window, not a destination.** We're building momentum toward December renewal, not trying to close everything in 90 days.

2. **Ryan is the key person.** Everything hinges on establishing relationship with him fast and showing we understand his priorities.

3. **Services aren't overhead—they're strategic.** $556K in services de-risks license expansion and creates customer dependency.

4. **Speed matters.** If we're slow, we lose urgency. If we're fast, we own the agenda.

5. **Proof of concept is everything.** By May 1, if askEdgi pilot is showing 40+ users and we've signed $248K in services, renewal is inevitable. Without that proof, renewal is a negotiation.

6. **Paul Wilson is the executive lever.** If we can make Paul our champion, he can unlock CFO budget and CEO alignment.

7. **Be honest about risks.** Don't oversell. Acknowledge the UI/UX issue. Acknowledge competitive risk. That honesty builds credibility.
